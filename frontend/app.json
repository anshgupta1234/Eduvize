    "description": "Eduvize works by allowing students to integrate the independent learning app of their choice, like Khan Academy or Duolingo, to their Eduvize account. Eduvize then monitors the student's progress in all of their connected apps and awards them tokens accordingly. These tokens can be used to purchase real gift cards or make in-app purchases. Eduvize also can use the data it collects on each student in order to effectively suggest other content for students to learn or practice based on what other similar users study. This helps keep students interested in learning!",
